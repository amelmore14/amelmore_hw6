      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Allison Elmore and I am a senior at the University of Iowa.
        In May, 2025 I will graduate with a degree in Business Analytics and
        Information Systems. Although school is a big part of my life, there is
        so much more to me than that. I currently work with the University of
        Iowa Health Care on the strategy team as their student assistant.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I am not at school or work I enjoy being outside if I can. I love
        to go on walks, hike, read, and just sit in nature. My schedule this
        semester gives me so much free time where I can spend all my afternoons
        outside if I wanted to.
      </p>
      <p>
        One big thing about me is I love to travel. I have been very blessed
        growing up to have a family who travels together each year, typically to
        somewhere out of the country. Since I was in 5th grade we have taken a
        trip each year that includes myself, mom, dad, sister, aunt, grandma and
        grandpa. Not a lot of people get these opportunites in life and I soak
        in each and every one of them. This year for my graduation trip we are
        taking a week long cruise in Alaska!
